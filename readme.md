# Emoji API Tracker App

This is a simple app using an emoji API to get and give a user access to every single emoji and its information.

This app will fetch all emoji data from the API https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/all. 
It will then prompt the user for an emoji's name and then return the specific data about the emoji, along with its unicode character.
Once the user is finished using the app, the app will finish running by returning every single emoji's name and its unicode character.

In order to know emoji names, the user is able to access every emoji name by inputting "all", or simply going to the API itself.
